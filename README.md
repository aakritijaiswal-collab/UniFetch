**Never make the exhausting 20-minute walk to the campus main gate alone again.**

UniFetch connects students waiting for packages at campus security gates with peers who are already heading in that direction. Fast, peer-to-peer delivery with zero courier hassles, secured by a tamper-proof 6-digit OTP handshake.

## 💡 What is UniFetch?

In most university campuses, commercial delivery drivers (Amazon, Flipkart, Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit) are barred from entering past the main security gate or turnstiles.

### The Problem:
- **Disrupted Lectures**: Delivery drivers call repeatedly while students are in class or lab.
- **Exhausting Walks**: Students waste 20–30 minutes walking 1.5+ km in scorching heat or rain just to retrieve small packages.
- **Misplaced Deliveries**: Parcels pile up haphazardly at security guard desks.

### The UniFetch Solution:
UniFetch creates a **hyperlocal student errand economy**:
1. **Request**: A student creates a request specifying their gate parcel and destination hostel/room.
2. **Match**: A fellow student already near the gate claims the delivery with zero detour.
3. **OTP Handshake**: The carrier brings the parcel to the hostel lobby. The requester verifies the package condition and shares their unique 6-digit OTP to complete the transaction and transfer credits.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🎨 Human-Crafted Campus Aesthetic**: High-energy, editorial design system featuring `Plus Jakarta Sans` & `Space Grotesk` fonts, warm oat canvas, interactive savings calculator, and live activity tickers.
- **📦 Smart Request Form**: Visual category selectors (Amazon, Food Delivery, Documents/Prints, Blinkit) with gate/hostel presets and room number inputs.
- **🚴 Carrier Command Center (`/carry`)**: Search and filter by gate, view time-remaining countdowns, and earn `+35 Credits 🪙` per delivery run.
- **📊 Real-time Order Dashboard (`/requests`)**: Active delivery progress tracker (*Published ➔ Claimed ➔ Delivered*) with 1-click OTP copy functionality and Supabase Realtime subscriptions.
- **🛡️ Tamper-Proof 6-Digit OTP**: Carriers cannot mark a parcel delivered without the requester's unique cryptographic code.
- **🪪 Strict ID Verification (`/verification`)**: Drag-and-drop ID upload dropzone with instant image preview.
- **👑 Admin Review Console (`/admin/verification`)**: Review pipeline with 10-minute temporary signed URLs for inspecting submitted ID cards.

## 🛠️ How It's Made & Tech Stack

UniFetch is built with a modern, resilient full-stack architecture designed for real-time responsiveness and strict campus security.

    A[Student Browser / Mobile] -->|Next.js 16 App Router| B[Frontend UI & Realtime Hooks]
    B -->|Supabase SSR Client| C[Supabase Auth & Session]

```

### 1. Frontend & UI
- **Framework**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Turbopack, React 19)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) with custom micro-textures, glassmorphism, and responsive layouts.
- **Typography**: `@import url` for Google Fonts (`Plus Jakarta Sans` + `Space Grotesk`).
- **Icons**: Custom accessible SVGs with semantic labels.

### 2. Backend & Database
- **Backend as a Service**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables.
- **Security & Authorization**:
  - PostgreSQL trigger `on_auth_user_created` automatically initializes student profiles upon signup.
  - Custom `SECURITY DEFINER` function `is_admin()` prevents RLS recursion.
  - Stored Procedure `verify_package_otp(p_request_id, p_otp)` cryptographically validates OTP match and executes atomic status changes.
- **Storage**: Private `college-ids` bucket with restrictive RLS policies and time-limited signed URLs for admin verification.
